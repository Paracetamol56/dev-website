  Here's another web tool that, while not essential in your life, is both enjoyable and handy for those moments of procrastination. As a Wikipedia enthusiast, I've always been intrigued by the connections between pages. My curiosity led me to create this tool, which allows users to search for a page and visualize the articles linked to it. You can dive deeper by expanding the nodes to uncover more pages and identify common articles between them. Enjoy!
